# Missing URL Test

This document tests handling of citations that lack corresponding
reference definitions.

## Introduction

Some sources are properly defined [1], while others are not [2].
This creates a mixed scenario for testing.

## Literature Review

The foundational work [3] is well-documented, but recent preprints
[4] and unpublished manuscripts [5] may not have stable URLs yet.

## Methods

We reference established protocols [1] and emerging techniques [6]
throughout this section.

## Discussion

Comparing traditional approaches [3] with newer methods [4] and [5]
reveals interesting tradeoffs. The unpublished work [6] shows promise.
