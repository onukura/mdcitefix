# Mixed Inline and References - LLM Chaos Test

This document simulates the chaotic citation patterns often found in LLM-generated reports.

## Introduction

According to [[1]] the field has evolved significantly.
Earlier work [6] established the foundation, while recent studies [10] have expanded on this.

## Background

The seminal paper [[2]] introduced the concept.
This was later refined [2] in multiple follow-up studies [[3]].
Another perspective can be found in [[2]] which is actually the same paper.

## Methodology

We follow the approach from [11], building on insights from [[4]].
The technique described in [5] and [[5]] provides the framework.

## Results

Our findings align with [[6]] and contradict [[7]].
See also [8] for additional context, and [[8]] for details.

## Discussion

Multiple sources [[1]], [10], and [[3]]
support our conclusions. The framework from [11] remains relevant.

## Conclusion

This work synthesizes ideas from [8] and recent developments [[9]].
