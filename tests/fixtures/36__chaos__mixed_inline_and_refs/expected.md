# Mixed Inline and References - LLM Chaos Test

This document simulates the chaotic citation patterns often found in LLM-generated reports.

## Introduction

According to [[5](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12345)] the field has evolved significantly.
Earlier work [1] established the foundation, while recent studies [2] have expanded on this.

## Background

The seminal paper [[1](https://example.com/seminal-work)] introduced the concept.
This was later refined [3] in multiple follow-up studies [[7](https://example.com/follow-up)].
Another perspective can be found in [[10](https://example.com/seminal-work)] which is actually the same paper.

## Methodology

We follow the approach from [4], building on insights from [[8](https://doi.org/10.1234/xyz)].
The technique described in [5] and [[15](https://example.com/technique)] provides the framework.

## Results

Our findings align with [[3](https://example.com/findings)] and contradict [[20](https://example.com/other-findings)].
See also [6] for additional context, and [[6](https://example.com/context)] for details.

## Discussion

Multiple sources [[100](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12345)], [2], and [[25](https://example.com/follow-up)]
support our conclusions. The framework from [4] remains relevant.

## Conclusion

This work synthesizes ideas from [6] and recent developments [[50](https://example.com/recent)].
