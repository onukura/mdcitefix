# Report: LLM-generated Draft (broken)

This statement is backed by policy docs [[4]] and by an analysis [ 2 ,3; 3 ].
A range is cited like this [5–7] (sometimes the dash is weird).
And sometimes it just writes (see [10]??) but [10] is not defined anywhere.
Same URL appears again under another number [99].

Inline link that must NOT be treated as a citation: [paper](https://papers.example.org/p/123).

> Quote with citations [3] and [8]. But [8] is a ghost.
