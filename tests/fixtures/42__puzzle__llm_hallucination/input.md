# LLM Hallucination - The Ultimate Citation Chaos

This simulates the kind of citation chaos that LLMs often generate in reports.

## Introduction (Citations Out of Order)

Recent advances in AI [157] have revolutionized the field. According to [3], building on [89],
and contradicting [42], we observe that [157, 3, 89, 42] all point to similar conclusions.
However, earlier work [2] predates [1], which references [999] (not yet defined).

## Literature Review (Duplicate URLs with Different Numbers)

The seminal paper [10] established the foundation. This was expanded by [20], refined by [30],
and critiqued by [40]. Interestingly, [50] cites [10, 20, 30, 40], but [60] contradicts [50].
Moreover, [70, 80, 90] all reference the same source with different numbers.

## Methodology (Missing and Phantom References)

We follow [101] (missing), inspired by [102] (missing), and guided by [103] (exists).
The approach from [404] (missing) contradicts [200-205] (partially missing).
See also [999] for future work and [777] for comprehensive analysis (both missing).

## Results (Random Number Explosion)

Findings support [5,17,23,31,47,51,59,67,71,83,89,97] with probability > 0.95.
Secondary evidence [11;13;17;19;23;29;31;37;41;43;47] suggests correlation.
Tertiary analysis [100-110, 200-210, 300-310] provides context (mostly undefined).

## Discussion (Same Content, Different Citations)

According to Smith et al. [1], Jones et al. [2], and Davis et al. [3],
the results are significant. Smith's work [10] (same as [1]) and
Jones's paper [20] (same as [2]) reinforce these findings.
Davis's research [30] (same as [3]) provides additional support.

## Contradictory Citations

The paper [5] claims X, but [5] also claims not-X in section 2.
Reference [7] supports [8], but [8] contradicts [7].
Circular reasoning: [9] cites [10], [10] cites [11], [11] cites [9].

## Formatting Chaos (Mixed Styles)

Some citations use [12, 13, 14] format.
Others use [15;16;17] with semicolons.
Ranges appear as [18-20] or [21, 22, 23].
Mixed: [24;25, 26-28, 29].

## Unicode and Special Cases

論文 [100] は日本語で書かれています。
The émigré study [101] uses accents.
Mathematical proof [102]: ∀x∈ℝ, ∃y∈ℝ such that x+y=0.
Emoji paper [103]: 🚀 to the moon! 🌙

## Extreme Nesting and Recursion

Study [110] references [111], which references [112], which references [113],
which references [114], which references [115], which references [110] (circular!).

The meta-analysis [120] analyzes analyses [121, 122, 123] of original studies [1-3].

## URL Chaos (Same URL, Many Numbers)

All of [201, 202, 203, 204, 205] point to https://example.com/popular-paper.
All of [301-310] point to https://example.com/highly-cited.
Different URLs but same topic: [401, 402, 403].

## The Grand Finale (Everything at Once)

综合analysis [1-500] incorporating perspectives from [501;502;503], [504, 505, 506],
and [507-510], while acknowledging limitations [404, 777, 999], suggests that
**bold [1]**, *italic [2]*, and `code[3]` citations in [1, 2, 3] contexts
> with blockquotes [4] and lists:
- Item [5]
  - Sub [6]
    - Deep [7]

Lead to conclusions [511-520, 777, 999] that require further investigation.
