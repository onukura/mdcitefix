# Simple Renumbering Test

This document tests the basic renumbering functionality where citations
are renumbered based on their order of first appearance, not their
original numbers.

## Introduction

The concept was first introduced by Smith [2] in their landmark paper.
However, earlier work by Jones [1] laid the groundwork for this approach.

## Related Work

Building on Jones [1], several researchers have explored this area.
Smith [2] provided the most comprehensive analysis to date.

## Methodology

We follow the approach outlined in Davis [5], which synthesizes
ideas from both Jones [1] and Smith [2]. Additional insights
come from Chen [3] and Wilson [4].

## Results

Our findings confirm the predictions made by Chen [3] and extend
the work of Wilson [4].

## Conclusion

This research validates the framework proposed by Davis [5] and
opens new avenues for future investigation.
