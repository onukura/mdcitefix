# Mixed Citation Formats Test

This tests various citation formats used together.

## Single Citations

Individual references [1] are the most basic format.

## Comma-Separated

Multiple citations [2, 3, 4] can be grouped with commas.

## Semicolon-Separated

Some styles use semicolons [5, 6, 7] for grouping.

## Range Format

Consecutive citations [8, 9, 10, 11] use range notation.

## Complex Mix

All formats together [1, 2, 3, 5, 12] show the parser's capability.

## Out of Order

Citations appear [12], [8, 9, 10, 11], [2], [3], and [4] in various orders
throughout the document.
